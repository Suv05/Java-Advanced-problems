        //(Hints: A number N is called perfect number, if the sum of factors except N as a factor is
        //equals to the number N.

        //Example:
        //N = 28 is a perfect number than (1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.)

        //Sample run1:
        //Enter a number: 496
        //496 is a perfect number.

        //Sample run2:
        //Enter a number: 490
        //490 is not a perfect number.
