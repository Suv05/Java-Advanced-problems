//Q-Write a program that finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using Euclid's
//algorithm, which is an iterative computation based on the following observation: if y divides
//x, the GCD of x and y is y; otherwise, the GCD of x and y is same as GCD of x % y and y.

//Sample run:
//Enter the first number: 56
//Enter the second number: 98
//GCD of 56 and 98 is 14
