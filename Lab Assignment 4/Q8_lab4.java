        //Q-Write a program that generates a random integer number between 1 and 10 and asks the user to
        //guess what the number is. If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program
        //should display "Too high, try again." If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the
        //program should display "Too low, try again." The program should use a loop that repeats until
        //the user correctly guesses the random number and display good guess.
        // Sample run:
        //Computer guess: 7
        //User guess: 5
        //Too low, try again
        //Computer guess: 5
        //User guess: 7
        //Too high, try again
        //Computer guess: 5
        //User guess: 5
        //Good guess
