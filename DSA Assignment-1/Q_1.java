/*Question-1:
Write a Java program that can take a positive integer greater than 2 as input and write out the
number of times one must repeatedly divide this number by 2 before getting a value less
than 2.
Sample Run:
The positive integer greater than 2 from command line argument
is 67.
The number of times one must repeatedly divide this number by 2
before getting a value less than 2 is 5.*/

        System.out.println("Enter your number");
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int count = 0;
//        for (int i=2;i<n;i++){
//            if (n / 2) {
//                count++;
